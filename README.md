 According to the research we discovered for Predicting Used Car Prices
dataset obtained from Kaggle platform. They employed three distinct machine learning
methods: linear regression, random forest regression, Support Vector Machine
regression. These models' mean squared errors (MSE) were 1.60, 0.70, and 1.20,
respectively. The Random Forest Regressor algorithm beat the other algorithms,
attaining the best results across all three metrics evaluated: RMSE, MSE, and Rsquared.
